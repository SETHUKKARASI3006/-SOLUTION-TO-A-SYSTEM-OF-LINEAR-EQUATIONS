# -SOLUTION-TO-A-SYSTEM-OF-LINEAR-EQUATIONS
## Aim:
To write a python program to find a solution to a system of linear equations.
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
### Step 4: 
End the program
## Program:
```
#Program to find the solution for the given linear equations.
#Developed by: SETHUKKARASI C
#RegisterNumber:23012881
import numpy
a=[[1,-3],[3,1]]
b=0,10
c=numpy.linalg.solve(a,b)
print(c)
```
## Output:
![solving_output](https://github.com/SETHUKKARASI3006/-SOLUTION-TO-A-SYSTEM-OF-LINEAR-EQUATIONS/assets/144979338/20a9bfd6-fd92-4325-9147-b85b83bdd500)

## Result: 
Thus the solutions for the linear equations are successfully solved using python program
